### Hello there ðŸ˜Š
I am a full-stack web developer with a prior 10+ year career in accounting and financial analysis. I have completed a General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp recently. I am keen to explore this new coding path further based on what I have achieved at General Assembly. I would like to make use of my prior work experience in accounting and finance in addition to global corporations liaising with colleagues in various countries.
